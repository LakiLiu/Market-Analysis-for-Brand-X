# Market-Analysis-for-Brand-X

### Backgrouds: 
1.  This is the group project in the Consumer Insights lecture. The aim is to analyse sports brand X's consumer survey data and tweet data to provide marketing insights and strategeis.
2. The data is composed by two parts
-  Company Survey data : large qualitive dataset include questions related to brand perception, sports perception and user experience.
-  Tweet data : it includes a large Tweets with hashtag of brand X and its competitors

### Exploration stage: 
1. Survey data : we conducted EDA to explore consumer profile and marketing pinpoints
2. Strategy:
- Classical 4P analysis 
- Tweet NLP analysis : this time we used R to conducted NLP. I found that the sentiment analysis in R is more colorful and in depth in python.
3. Marketing Plan: we elaborated the marketing compagin to enforce product reliability 

### Conclusions and Reflection:
1. For qualitive datasets, especially the standards are not very different (for example, for questions "how are you satisfied the packaging", all the people rate from 1-4, from neutre to slightly, a little, very much, extremely satisfied), I find we can define extra ratio or other KPI to derive insights. Otherwise, the results are very superfical.
2. Python library ploty is extremely useful for advanced plots.
